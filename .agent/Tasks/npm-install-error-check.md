# Task: npm install error capture

## Summary
- Ran `npm install` at repo root on Node.js environment (`npm 10`). Installation completed successfully with no dependency warnings or errors.

## Observations
- npm reported `up to date` and did not recreate a `package-lock.json` because `package-lock=false` by default under pnpm-managed workspace.
- 161 packages advertise funding links; no action required.

## Next Steps
- None required. If future runs surface issues, document them here with full error output.

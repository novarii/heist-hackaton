# Dependency Version Audit (2025-10-14)

We inventoried first-party dependencies before installing anything, with a focus on identifying deprecated or outdated versions that could block future work. No packages were installed or upgraded as part of this audit.

## Summary

| Package | Current | Latest Stable | Update Type | Notes | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `next` | 14.2.3 | 15.5.4 | Major | Aligns with React 19 and Turbopack defaults; `next lint` is deprecated in 15.5 so CLI scripts should move to `eslint`. | [Next docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/eslint) |

| `typescript` | 5.4.5 | 5.9.3 | Major | 5.9 enables `import defer` and refreshed `tsc --init`; ensure Node â‰¥18.18. | [TypeScript release](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/releases/tag/v5.9.3) |
| `eslint` | 8.57.0 | 9.36.0 | Major | ESLint 9 ships new config system tweaks; verify plugin compatibility. | [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) |
| `eslint-config-next` | 14.2.3 | 15.5.3 | Major | Must match Next runtime to avoid rule drift. | [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-next?activeTab=versions) |

## Additional Notes

- Major upgrades (`next`, `react`, `tailwindcss`, `typescript`, `eslint`, etc.) will require coordinated code changes and CI validation. Capture each upgrade path as its own task with regression plans.
- `tailwindcss` 4+ introduces a CSS-first configuration model; confirm how this interacts with current `tailwind.config.ts` before cutting over.
- `eslint` 9 drops the legacy flat config fallback; ensure our rule presets (including custom ones) migrate cleanly, or pin temporarily during the Next 15 move.
- `vitest` 3 requires Vite 6 peer compatibility. Our current scaffold lacks a Vitest setup beyond a single unit test; plan the Vite tooling upgrade at the same time.
- No action needed for `date-fns` (3.6.0 remains the latest stable) or other dependencies not listed above.
